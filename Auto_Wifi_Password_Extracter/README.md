- Attempt to retrieve the passwords for each (if they exist)
- Save the names and passwords in a file named:

  ```
  nothing_to_see_here420869.txt

- Then, it reads and prints the contents of a file named:

  ```

## üì¶ Recommended: Convert to Executable (.exe)

To run this on another Windows system without Python installed:

1. Install [`pyinstaller`](https://www.pyinstaller.org/):

   ```bash
   pip install pyinstaller
   ```

2. Convert the script to an executable:

   ```bash
   pyinstaller --onefile wifi_password_extractor.py
   ```

   The generated `.exe` will be found in the `dist` folder.
