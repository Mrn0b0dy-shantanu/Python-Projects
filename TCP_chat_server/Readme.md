# 💬 TCP Chat Room

### A beginner‑friendly(almost) multi‑client chat application built with Python sockets and threads. Every key function is commented for **clarity** and **learning python and sockets.**

### This project enables multiple users to join a chat room over TCP. A central server handles client connections, broadcasts messages, and notifies users of joins and disconnects in real time.
